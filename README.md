The following Project was completed during the COVID-19 Pnademic. I wanted to represent the numbeical data from rt.live and present it in a visual way that was more intuitive to understand. Red values indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic would continue in that given state (R0 value >=1) and green values inddicate that the pandemic would end since not enough people are getting infected for every person that is sick.

The Image below was during the second wave of COVID infections in the UNited States and the data suggested that every person (in the states that are colored red) are infecting more thatn one other person. Thid means that the rate at which COVID is spreading is increasing.

The Image below suggests the opposite, that for every person, fewer than one person (on average) is getting infected with COVID

The Jupyter Notebook Contains all the code used in the analysis and a function so that any date can be viewed.
