The following Project was completed during the COVID-19 Pnademic. I wanted to represent the numbeical data from rt.live and present it in a visual way that was more intuitive to understand. Red values indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic would continue in that given state (R0 value >=1) and green values inddicate that the pandemic would end since not enough people are getting infected for every person that is sick.
